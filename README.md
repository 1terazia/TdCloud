# TdCloud
### Introduction
Recently I faced with problem: the amount of memory in my iCloud and Google Drive is less than 15Gb. So, it's hard to back up even photos. 
Although, Telegram has open-source API TDLib, which allow me to send and upload files/photos to chats. 
This inspired me to implement CLI script, which could back up any folders and files from laptop, because Telegram has unlimited storage.
### Libraries
- TDLib
- boost(filesystem)
